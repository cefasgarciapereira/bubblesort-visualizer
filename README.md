# Graphic Computer
This repository actually contains several projects that explore the visual aspect of computing. The main tool that makes up these projects is the P5.js.

## Running
To execute any of the projects, just open the `index.html` in your browser.

## Bubblesort Visualizer
This project is the implementation of the famous [bubblesort](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort) algorithm, performed in the P5.js framework, which allows us to see an animation of how the algorithm works.

Bellow you can check the example:

## Hearth Equation
This project is the implementation of the curious [hearth equation](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/HeartCurve.html), performed in the P5.js library, which allows us to see an animation of the equation curves.

Bellow you can check the example:

## Monte Carlo Pi
This project is the implementation of the [Monte Carlo Pi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method), performed in the P5.js library. This method consists in the idea of throwing random points in the canvas. Some points will be inside the circle, others will be outside the circle (inside the square). The more points you have, closer you are to cover the whole area of the shapes. By apllyin a relation beetween the areas of the shapes, it is possible to estimate the number PI.

Bellow you can check the example:

## Barnsley Fern
This project is the implementation of the [Barnsley Fern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnsley_fern), the fern is one of the basic examples of self-similar sets, i.e. it is a mathematically generated pattern that can be reproducible at any magnification or reduction.

Bellow you can check the example, and you also can check rendered images inside the project folder.

## Fractal Tree
This project is the implementation of the [Fractal Tree] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_tree_index), this fractal consists of recursively applying a rotation in the generation of the branch and decreasing its length in half. This process performed repeatedly generate a tree.

Bellow you can check the example:

## L System
An L-system or Lindenmayer system is a parallel rewriting system and a type of formal grammar. An L-system consists of an alphabet of symbols that can be used to make strings, a collection of production rules that expand each symbol into some larger string of symbols, an initial "axiom" string from which to begin construction, and a mechanism for translating the generated strings into geometric structures. L-systems were introduced and developed in 1968 by Aristid Lindenmayer, a Hungarian theoretical biologist and botanist at the University of Utrecht. Lindenmayer used L-systems to describe the behaviour of plant cells and to model the growth processes of plant development. L-systems have also been used to model the morphology of a variety of organisms[1] and can be used to generate self-similar fractals.

## Mandelbrot Set
This project is the implementation of the [Mandelbrot Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set), performed in the P5.js library. The Mandelbrot Set is the set of complex numbers c for which the function fc(z) = zÂ² + c does not diverge when iterated from z > 0.

Bellow you can check the example:
