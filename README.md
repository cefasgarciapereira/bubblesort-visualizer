# Graphic Computer
This repository actually contains several projects that explore the visual aspect of computing. The main tool that makes up these projects is the P5.js.

## Running
To execute any of the projects, just open the `index.html` in your browser.

## Bubblesort Visualizer
This project is the implementation of the famous [bubblesort](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort) algorithm, performed in the P5.js framework, which allows us to see an animation of how the algorithm works.

Bellow you can check the example:

# Hearth Equation
This project is the implementation of the curious [hearth equation](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/HeartCurve.html), performed in the P5.js library, which allows us to see an animation of the equation curves.

Bellow you can check the example:
