# Graphic Computer
This repository actually contains several projects that explore the visual aspect of computing. The main tool that makes up these projects is the P5.js.

## Running
To execute any of the projects, just open the `index.html` in your browser.

## Bubblesort Visualizer
This project is the implementation of the famous [bubblesort](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort) algorithm, performed in the P5.js framework, which allows us to see an animation of how the algorithm works.

Bellow you can check the example:

## Hearth Equation
This project is the implementation of the curious [hearth equation](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/HeartCurve.html), performed in the P5.js library, which allows us to see an animation of the equation curves.

Bellow you can check the example:

## Monte Carlo Pi
This project is the implementation of the [Monte Carlo Pi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method), performed in the P5.js library, which allows us to see an animation of the equation curves. This method consists in the idea of throwing random points in the canvas. Some points will be inside the circle, others will be outside the circle (inside the square). The more points you have, closer you are to cover the whole area of the shapes. By apllyin a relation beetween the areas of the shapes, it is possible to estimate the number PI.

Bellow you can check the example:
